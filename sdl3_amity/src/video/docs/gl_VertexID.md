# gl_VertexID
contains the index of the current vertex

## Description
[`Gl::vertex_id`] is a vertex language input variable that holds an
  integer index for the vertex. The index is implicitly generated by
  [`Gl::draw_arrays`] and other commands that do not reference the
  content of the [`gl::ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER`], or explicitly generated
  from the content of the [`gl::ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER`] by commands such
  as [`Gl::draw_elements`]. For [`Gl::draw_elements`] forms that take a
  `basevertex`, [`Gl::vertex_id`] will have this value added to the
  index from the buffer.
