# glGetBufferPointerv
return the pointer to a mapped buffer object's data store

## Parameters
- `target`
  Specifies the target to which the buffer object is bound for
  [`Gl::get_buffer_pointerv`], which must be one of the buffer binding
  targets in the following table:

## Description
[`Gl::get_buffer_pointerv`] and [`Gl::get_named_buffer_pointerv`]
  return the buffer pointer `pname`, which must be
  [`gl::BUFFER_MAP_POINTER`]. The single buffer map pointer is returned
  in `params`. A [`NULL`] pointer is returned if the buffer object's
  data store is not currently mapped; or if the requesting context did
  not map the buffer object's data store, and the implementation is
  unable to support mappings on multiple clients.

## Notes
If an error is generated, no change is made to the contents of
  `params`.
The initial value for the pointer is [`NULL`].
The [`gl::ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER`] target is available only if the GL
  version is 4.2 or greater.
The [`gl::DISPATCH_INDIRECT_BUFFER`] and [`gl::SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER`]
  targets are available only if the GL version is 4.3 or greater.
The [`gl::QUERY_BUFFER`] target is available only if the GL version is
  4.4 or greater.

## Errors
- [`gl::INVALID_ENUM`] is generated if by [`Gl::get_buffer_pointerv`] if
  `target` is not one of the accepted buffer targets, or if `pname` is
  not [`gl::BUFFER_MAP_POINTER`].
- [`gl::INVALID_OPERATION`] is generated by [`Gl::get_buffer_pointerv`]
  if zero is bound to `target`.
- [`gl::INVALID_OPERATION`] is generated by
  [`Gl::get_named_buffer_pointerv`] if `buffer` is not the name of an
  existing buffer object.
