# glResumeTransformFeedback
resume transform feedback operations

## Description
[`Gl::resume_transform_feedback`] resumes transform feedback
  operations on the currently active transform feedback object. When
  transform feedback operations are paused, transform feedback is still
  considered active and changing most transform feedback state related
  to the object results in an error. However, a new transform feedback
  object may be bound while transform feedback is paused.

## Errors
- [`gl::INVALID_OPERATION`] is generated if the currently bound
  transform feedback object is not active or is not paused.
